# Dyalog Problem Solving Competition -- solutions in k

Here are solutions in k to Dyalog's run of competition problems, available [here](https://problems.tryapl.org/).

The k-flavour is k6-ish: [ngn/k](https://codeberg.org/ngn/k). I've had plenty of help from the fine folk on the [k-tree](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/90748/the-k-tree) chat room.
